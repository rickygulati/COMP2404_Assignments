Purpose: This program is designed for assignment 4 of COMP2404A for Winter 2021 term.
         The program implements a program to manage a hotel. The hotel will have multiple rooms of different types, including a suite, some
         premium rooms, and regular rooms. The hotel will also keep track of the multiple guests that stay at the hotel.
         The reservations will be managed by a separate control-like object, that serves as the reservation manager.
         When a new reservation is requested, the reservation manager will be responsible for determining which room
         of the requested type is available for the duration of the guestâ€™s stay.
